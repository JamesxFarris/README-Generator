## Description

The main goal of this project is to create an easy-to-use solution to generate a solid README that can be used on any of your repos on GitHub. This is done by using Node.js and taking a few prompts from the user, then distributing them throughout a README template using template literals. It includes an index.js file that provides all of the necessary questions and the license selection, and a generatemarkdown.js file to process the license selection and return the correct data for populating the readme.

- [License](#license)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [Tests](#tests)
- [Questions](#questions)

## Installation

Once cloned, you can use the following command in the terminal:

npm i

This will install the necessary dependencies, in this case, Inquirer 6.3.1. Once installed, you can proceed to use node.js to run the program.

## Usage

In order to use the generator use the following steps:

- In the console, use the following: node index,js

- Respond to all the prompts with as little, or as much detail as desired

- All info will be written to a README file saved within your current directory
